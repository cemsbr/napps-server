## Main Highlights

### Speed focused

We keep the word *performance* in mind since the beginning of the 
development. Also, as computer scientists, we will always try to get the 
best performance by using the most suitable algorithms.

### Rest APIs

This web server was developed to provide simple and powerfull Rest APIs. 
By using this APIs you will be able to query, update, add and delete 
your applications in this repository. 

### Born to be free

OpenFlow was born with a simple idea: make your network more vendor 
agnostic and we like that!

We are advocates and supporters of free software and we believe that the 
more eyes observe the code, the better it will be. This project can 
receive support from many vendors, but will never follow a particular 
vendor direction.

*napps-server* will always be free software.
